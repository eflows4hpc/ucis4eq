  sudo sh get-docker.sh
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```
  Find more installation options in:

  ```

  https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### 2 - Install image on the local host

Due to the image was registered on the GitLab repository, first step is doing login

```
  docker login registry.gitlab.com
```

##### Obtain the docker-composer.yml and .env file from the GitLab repository

```
  curl --request GET --header 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: bZA9JyDsdqyzawJngzzy' 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12232768/repository/files/docker-compose.yml/raw?ref=master' > docker-compose.yml
  curl --request GET --header 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: bZA9JyDsdqyzawJngzzy' 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12232768/repository/files/.env/raw?ref=master' > .env  
```

## Manual TEST Example

### 1 - Start the UCIS4EQ System
Open a terminal and be sure that both .env and docker-compose.yml are in the such directory. Then, run:

```
docker-compose up 
```

### 2 - Download the event setup
```
curl --request GET --header 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: bZA9JyDsdqyzawJngzzy' 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12232768/repository/files/data%2FSISZ_EQEventExample.json/raw?ref=master' > SISZ_EQEventExample.json
```

### 3 - Trigger a manual alert
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @SISZ_EQEventExample.json http://127.0.0.1:5001/WMEmulator
```

Notice that .env file and all configuration files should be provided for a right behaviour
